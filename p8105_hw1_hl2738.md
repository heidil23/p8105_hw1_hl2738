## Problem 1

#### Data frame creation

This code chunk creates a data frame comprised of a random sample of
size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating
whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of
length 10, and a factor vector of length 10 with 3 different factor
levels:

``` r
library(tidyverse)

problem_1_df =
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 1),
    samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
    color = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple", "teal", "black", "brown", "white"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("low", "high", "med", "med", "low", "high", "low", "med", "high", "high"))
  )
```

The data frame created appears as follows:

| norm\_samp | samp\_pos | color  | vec\_factor |
|-----------:|:----------|:-------|:------------|
|  3.3771592 | TRUE      | red    | low         |
|  1.9635200 | TRUE      | orange | high        |
|  1.0043103 | TRUE      | yellow | med         |
|  1.1913229 | TRUE      | green  | med         |
|  2.2963343 | TRUE      | blue   | low         |
|  0.8188963 | TRUE      | purple | high        |
|  2.2944799 | TRUE      | teal   | low         |
| -0.5812866 | FALSE     | black  | med         |
|  1.1286371 | TRUE      | brown  | high        |
|  0.4579212 | TRUE      | white  | high        |

#### Mean of each variable

This code chunk takes the mean of each of the 4 variables in the data
frame:

``` r
mean_samp = mean(pull(problem_1_df, norm_samp))
mean_samp_pos = mean(pull(problem_1_df, samp_pos))
mean_color = mean(pull(problem_1_df, color))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem_1_df, color)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
mean_vec_fac = mean(pull(problem_1_df, vec_factor))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem_1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
## or logical: returning NA
```

The code returns error messages for the variables “color” and
“vec\_factor,” because it is not possible to take the mean of a
character varaible (“color”) or a factor variable (“vec\_factor”).

#### Convert to numeric variables

This code chunk attempts to convert the logical, character, and factor
variables to numeric variables.

``` r
problem_1_df$samp_pos <- as.numeric(problem_1_df$samp_pos)
problem_1_df$color <- as.numeric(problem_1_df$color)
problem_1_df$vec_factor <- as.numeric(problem_1_df$vec_factor)
```

The logical variable “samp\_pos” and the factor variable “vec\_factor”
can be converted to numeric variables, however the character variable
“color” cannot be converted to a numeric variable. This explains what
happens when you try to take the mean, because while the logical
variable was already stored as number and therefore a mean could be
calculated, this was not the case for the character variable and the
factor variable. While the factor variable can be converted to a numeric
variable using the as.numeric function, character variables cannot be
converted to numeric variables, and therefore a mean cannot be
calculated.
