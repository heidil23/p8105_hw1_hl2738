## Problem 1

#### Data frame creation

This code chunk creates a data frame comprised of a random sample of
size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating
whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of
length 10, and a factor vector of length 10 with 3 different factor
levels:

``` r
library(tidyverse)

problem_1_df =
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 1),
    samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
    color = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple", "teal", "black", "brown", "white"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("low", "high", "med", "med", "low", "high", "low", "med", "high", "high"))
  )
```

The data frame created appears as follows:

| norm\_samp | samp\_pos | color  | vec\_factor |
|-----------:|:----------|:-------|:------------|
|  0.6570530 | TRUE      | red    | low         |
|  0.4307808 | TRUE      | orange | high        |
|  1.1910321 | TRUE      | yellow | med         |
|  0.1405618 | TRUE      | green  | med         |
|  0.6590648 | TRUE      | blue   | low         |
|  0.1974239 | TRUE      | purple | high        |
|  1.1699538 | TRUE      | teal   | low         |
|  0.4678146 | TRUE      | black  | med         |
|  1.8710189 | TRUE      | brown  | high        |
|  3.0367795 | TRUE      | white  | high        |

#### Mean of each variable

This code chunk takes the mean of each of the 4 variables in the data
frame:

``` r
mean_samp = mean(pull(problem_1_df, norm_samp))
mean_samp_pos = mean(pull(problem_1_df, samp_pos))
mean_color = mean(pull(problem_1_df, color))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem_1_df, color)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
mean_vec_fac = mean(pull(problem_1_df, vec_factor))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem_1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
## or logical: returning NA
```

The code returns error messages for the variables “color” and
“vec\_factor,” because it is not possible to take the mean of a
character varaible (“color”) or a factor variable (“vec\_factor”).

#### Convert to numeric variables

This code chunk attempts to convert the logical, character, and factor
variables to numeric variables.

``` r
problem_1_df$samp_pos <- as.numeric(problem_1_df$samp_pos)
problem_1_df$color <- as.numeric(problem_1_df$color)
problem_1_df$vec_factor <- as.numeric(problem_1_df$vec_factor)
```

The logical variable “samp\_pos” and the factor variable “vec\_factor”
can be converted to numeric variables, however the character variable
“color” cannot be converted to a numeric variable. This explains what
happens when you try to take the mean, because while the logical
variable was already stored as number and therefore a mean could be
calculated, this was not the case for the character variable and the
factor variable. While the factor variable can be converted to a numeric
variable using the as.numeric function, character variables cannot be
converted to numeric variables, and therefore a mean cannot be
calculated.

## Problem 2

This code chunk imports the Penguins dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### Description of Penguins dataset

The data frame has 344 rows and 8 columns. The dataset includes the
following variables: species, island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm,
flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year.

The dataset was collected between 2007 and 2009. There are a total of
344 penguins in the data set. There are 168 male penguins and 165 female
penguins. Penguins came from three different islands (Biscoe, Dream,
Torgersen) and included three different species (Adelie, Chinstrap,
Gentoo).

The mean flipper length is 200.92 mm, and the mean bill length is 43.92
mm.

#### Penguins scatterplot

This code chunk creates a scatterplot of flipper length (mm) vs. bill
length (mm):

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

![](p8105_hw1_hl2738_files/figure-gfm/scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

The scatterplot shows a positive relationship between penguin flipper
length and penguin bill length. The three penguin species are denoted by
color.

This code chunk exports the scatterplot as a pdf file.

``` r
ggsave("penguins_scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```
