## Problem 1

This **code chunk** creates a data frame comprised of a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10 with 3 different factor levels:

```{r problem_1}
library(tidyverse)

problem_1_df =
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 1),
    samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
    color = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple", "teal", "black", "brown", "white"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("low", "high", "med", "med", "low", "high", "low", "med", "high", "high"))
  )
